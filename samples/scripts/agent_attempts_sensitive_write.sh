#!/usr/bin/env bash
# agent_attempts_sensitive_write.sh — simulates an agent that attempts both
# safe and policy-violating writes in the same run.
#
# Airlock governance outcome (with --policy-pack strict):
#   src/output.txt       → ALLOWED   (within allow_write: src/**)
#   .env                 → BLOCKED   (touchesSensitivePath: always HardBlocked)
#   deploy_config.yaml   → BLOCKED   (path contains "deploy": HardBlocked)
#
# The blocked writes are reverted in the workspace. POLICY_DENY events are
# recorded in events.jsonl with the attempted diff.
# The run exits 0 because the shell command itself completed.
#
# Use in Airlock:
#   ./airlock run --agent generic-shell \
#     --cmd "$(cat samples/scripts/agent_attempts_sensitive_write.sh)" \
#     --repo . --policy-pack strict --approval deny-high-risk
