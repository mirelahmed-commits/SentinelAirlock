# Sentinel Airlock

**v2.2.0-rc1** · Go 1.22 · local-first · no SaaS required

Sentinel Airlock is an agent-governance boundary for coding agents. It wraps agent execution with policy controls, writes a tamper-evident evidence trail, and gives reviewers a full set of post-run tools — inspect, replay, verify, review, export — that work entirely from recorded evidence artifacts, with no agent dependency at review time. Local-first, not a SaaS dashboard. Only captures workflows launched through Airlock.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Go | 1.22+ | Build only |
| make | any | Build only |
| Git | any | |
| Docker / Colima / Podman | any | Container sandbox only — optional |

## Install / Build

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd sentinel-airlock
make build
./airlock --version
```

`make build` produces a single `./airlock` binary. No further install step required.

To install to PATH:
```bash
make install PREFIX=$HOME/bin
# or
scripts/install.sh "$HOME/bin"
```

Container runtime (Docker / Colima / Podman) is only needed for `--sandbox container`. The default workspace sandbox runs without it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 0. Check environment
./airlock doctor

# 1. Set up your project
cd your-project
airlock bootstrap          # writes airlock.yaml + .airlock/

# 2. Run an agent under governance
airlock run --agent generic-shell --cmd 'mkdir -p src && echo hi > src/test.txt' --repo .
# → run_id printed; use 'latest' as a shorthand everywhere below

# 3. Inspect the evidence
airlock inspect latest
airlock verify latest

# 4. Review the run
airlock review latest --state approved --note "looks clean"

# 5. Export an evidence bundle
airlock export latest --format zip --include-report

# 6. Browse all runs in the operator viewer
airlock serve --background --open   # detached — keeps your terminal
airlock serve --status              # mode / URL / PID / log
airlock serve --stop                # clean shutdown
```

### Try it now (self-contained, ~60 seconds)

```bash
bash samples/quickstart.sh
```

Builds, bootstraps, runs a governed command, inspects, verifies, and opens the viewer — entirely against the project's own directory. No Docker, no API keys.

For a full operator walkthrough — fresh target repo, allow/deny policy, both allowed and denied agent writes, background viewer, browser-driven rollback, and an original-repo honesty check:

```bash
bash samples/operator-walkthrough.sh
# PORT=8090 bash samples/operator-walkthrough.sh   # override viewer port
```

Additional examples (governance denial, CLI rollback, BYOM integration) are in [`scripts/dev/`](scripts/dev/).

See [`samples/QUICKSTART.md`](samples/QUICKSTART.md) for a copy-paste walkthrough with expected output.

### Viewer modes & lifecycle

The viewer has two explicit modes and can run in the foreground or detached:

| Command | Mode | Runs in |
|---|---|---|
| `airlock serve` | **operator** — review / rollback / export can execute from the UI (with confirmation) | foreground |
| `airlock serve --read-only` | **read-only** — safe to share; state changes appear as terminal commands, never mutating buttons | foreground |
| `airlock serve --background --open` | operator, detached | background |
| `airlock serve --background --read-only --open` | read-only, detached | background |
| `airlock serve --status` | — | reports mode / URL / PID / log |
| `airlock serve --stop` | — | stops the running viewer |

`--background` returns the terminal immediately, prints the URL/PID/log path, and records `.airlock/viewer.json` (+ `viewer.pid`, `viewer.log`). A second `serve` refuses to start a duplicate and points you at the running one; a stale PID (process gone) is cleaned automatically. In **operator mode**, a `Restore workspace` button runs the *same* rollback as the CLI (`internal/rollback`, not a subprocess) after a strong confirmation — and still restores only the Airlock workspace, never your original repo.

The viewer is built to be operated without knowing Airlock's internal artifact model:

- **What should I do next?** — every run page opens with state-dependent guidance (review the patch, re-review after rollback, inspect denied writes, or nothing to do).
- **Replay summary** — a plain-language playback grouped by phase (setup, allowed changes, denials, evidence), with the raw event stream tucked into a drilldown. Noisy environment-hardening events (`ENV_DENY`) are collapsed into a single neutral "Environment guardrail" note, not ~20 red rows.
- **Rollback in plain terms** — before rollback you see the exact commands and what they restore; after rollback you see what changed. Every rollback panel states that it restores the *Airlock workspace* (`.airlock/workspaces/<id>/repo`), **not your original repo**.
- **Live updates** — the viewer polls local evidence and auto-refreshes when a run is added or its review/verify/rollback/export state changes. Run a `review` or `rollback` command in a terminal and the open page updates itself. In `--read-only` mode, state-changing actions are shown as terminal commands instead of buttons that appear to mutate.

The self-contained HTML report (`report/index.html`, no JavaScript, no network) tells the same story for offline sharing.

## What the Demo Proves

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Wraps any agent | `run` accepts any adapter: `generic-shell`, `codex`, and more |
| Full audit trail | `events.jsonl`, `session_events.jsonl`, `run_manifest.json` written per run |
| Tamper-evident | `run_digest.json` (SHA-256) — `airlock verify` checks it |
| Policy gates | `airlock.yaml` path patterns + 5 named policy packs |
| Sandbox isolation | Repo copied to isolated workspace before agent executes |
| Human reviewable | `review.json` — reviewer, state, note, timestamp |
| Exportable | `export --format zip` or `--format tar.gz` |
| Offline browsable | `serve` — local HTTP viewer, no network, no SaaS |

## Configuration

`airlock bootstrap` writes an `airlock.yaml`. Key fields:

```yaml
workspace:
  ignore: [".git", "node_modules"]

policy:
  deny_write: ["*.env", ".ssh/**"]
  allow_write: ["**/*.go"]

network:
  mode: off          # off | on | allowlist

defaults:
  mode: dev          # dev | team | ci
  sandbox: workspace # workspace | container | off
```

**Built-in policy packs** (`--policy-pack`): `balanced`, `strict`, `ci-safe`, `oss-maintainer`, `research`

**Execution mode defaults** (`--mode`):

| Mode | Sandbox | Network | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev` | workspace | off | auto |
| `team` | container | allowlist | deny-high-risk |
| `ci` | container | off | deny-high-risk |

## Artifact Model

Every run writes to `.airlock/runs/<run_id>/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `events.jsonl` | Structured event log — policy, sandbox, risk events |
| `session_events.jsonl` | Model/tool/message session trace |
| `run_manifest.json` | Full run metadata — adapter, sandbox, policy decisions |
| `run_digest.json` | SHA-256 digest of core evidence artifacts (rebuilt by `export` and `rollback`) |
| `run_digest.sig` | Optional ed25519 signature |
| `changes.patch` | Unified diff of workspace changes |
| `report/index.html` | Static HTML evidence report (self-contained, no external dependencies) |
| `checkpoints/cp-0/` | Workspace snapshot at run start |
| `review.json` | Review decision (state, note, reviewer, timestamp) |
| `rollback.json` | Rollback record — checkpoint, mode, paths, timestamp, status |

## BYOM Agent Runtime Integration

Airlock's `generic-shell` adapter lets you run any process-based or LLM-backed agent under governance without modifying the Airlock binary. The included BYOM integration demonstrates this pattern:

```bash
# Normal governed run — stdlib-only, no network, no API keys
./airlock run \
  --agent generic-shell \
  --cmd "python3 integrations/byom-agent/agent.py \
    --task 'Summarize project context' \
    --context README.md \
    --output docs/byom-agent-notes.md" \
  --repo samples/byom-workspace \
  --policy integrations/byom-agent/policy.airlock.yaml

# Full demo (normal run + governance test with policy-denied writes)
bash scripts/dev/demo-byom.sh
```

**What Airlock captures:** process-level evidence — file events, risk classification, policy decisions, command output. Adapters that emit session events populate `session_events.jsonl`; `generic-shell` emits basic wrappers.

**To connect a local LLM:** replace `analyze_context()` in `integrations/byom-agent/agent.py` with a call to Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. See [`integrations/byom-agent/README.md`](integrations/byom-agent/README.md) for connection patterns.

## Trust & Security Story

- Policy deny + revert on blocked writes
- Risk + approval metadata on events
- Digest generation (`run_digest.json`) for tamper evidence
- Optional signing (`run_digest.sig`) when signing key configured
- Review state persisted as separate artifact (`review.json`)

## Local vs Remote

- **Local:** `airlock run ...`
- **Remote:** `airlock worker start` + `airlock submit` + `airlock fetch`
- Fetched remote runs use the same artifact model and commands (`inspect`, `replay`, `verify`, `serve`).

## Current Limitations

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and [`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

## Roadmap Snapshot

- V2.2 complete: packaging/operator readiness

- Next: first public RC + early user feedback loop

## Contribution / Dev

- Start with `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Security disclosures: `SECURITY.md`
- Demo and onboarding: `samples/QUICKSTART.md`
- Release process: `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`

## Known Limitations / Non-Goals

- **Workspace sandbox caveat:** In workspace mode, the agent process runs on the host OS. The workspace directory boundary is best-effort, not OS-enforced. Container is recommended for stronger isolation.
- **Only captures through Airlock:** Only captures workflows launched through `airlock run`. Not a system-wide agent monitor.
- Agent backend CLIs must be installed separately; Airlock wraps them.
- Container sandbox depends on host runtime availability (Docker/Colima/Podman) and socket access.
- Remote auth is shared-token only — no per-user IAM at v2.2.0-rc1.
- Airlock is **not** a hosted SaaS dashboard or control plane.
- Airlock is **not** a replacement for OS-level security or network perimeter controls.
